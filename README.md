# Visualization of Top Played Artists/Albums/Songs on Spotify

**Setup:**
1. Create a `tmp` directory, with the subdirectories `tmp/raw_data/most-recent-export`.
2. In there, add your `Spotify Extended Streaming History` directory. You can get it by 
   requesting & then downloading your extended streaming history from your Spotify 
   account's "Privacy" section on [spotify.com](https://www.spotify.com/de/account/privacy/).
3. To run the code, execute `make`, or `cd bin && ./run.sh`, or `cd src && ./main.py` manually.
